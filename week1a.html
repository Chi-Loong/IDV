                    <h2>Teaching</h2>
                    <p>I have taught three previous semesters of interactive data visualization at SUTD's HASS <a href="https://chi-loong.github.io/HASS02.526/">masters' course</a> &mdash; this very module.</p>
                    <p>I am also an adjunct lecturer at SIT, and I have taught <a href="https://showcase.vslashr.com/sit_csc2005/">web dev</a> and now teach a technical <a href="https://chi-loong.github.io/CSC3007/">visualization course</a> to year 3 computer engineering grads.</p>
                    <p>I have also taught at code schools like General Assembly and SGCodeCampus, mainly on visualization.</p>

                    <h3>Course vision</h3>
                    <p>There are three ways to approach the domain - research, technical, or industry.</p>
                    <p>As a practitioner in the space I tend to approach the domain from an industry perspective with a technical slant.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Speakers</h3>
                    <p>For a masters course, I feel that the greatest value is in discussing real-life work and networking.</p>
                    <p>Hence I tend to invite and curate guest lectures by people in the industry. For 2022 I had 4 guest speakers, and for 2023 I hope to have at least 3.</p>
                    <p>Speakers range from journalists, to data scientists, to UX practitioners.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Design and code</h3>
                    <p>This course is split up into two components &mdash; <b>design</b> and <b>code</b>.</p>
                    <p>In the <b>design</b> portion, we will go through the academia / research / case studies in what makes for good data visualization design.</p>
                    <p>In the <b>code</b> portion, we will be building interactive data visualizations for the web.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>On technology</h3>
                    <p>Visualizations can be built with all kinds of software tool / cloud-based platforms.</p>
                    <p>However, for an interactive visualization course I will going through how to do it natively for the web.</p>
                    <p>This namely means using <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3 (Data Driven Documents)</a>, the defacto data visualization library for the web.</p>
                </section> 
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Viz tools</h3>
                    <img src="img/viztools.jpg"/>
                    <p class="smallfont">Will revisit this again in the lecture on <i>why</i> we do visualization.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Why D3</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>If you're interested in analytics, Excel / Tableau / PowerBI are good non-coding choices.</li>
                    <li>If you're familiar with data science languages, Python or R has graphing libraries (ggplot2, plotly, mathlibplot, etc.)</li>
                    <li>D3 is used because you want to <b>build beautiful interactive visualizations</b> for the web. You can implement any interactions you want.</li>
                    <li>It also has comprehensive built-in <b>design patterns for visualizations</b>, like geo projections, force simulations, hierarchies, etc.</li>
                    <li>Lastly, it is open source and free.</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Why web</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>For web visualization there are many libraries / tools / platforms beyond D3.</li>
                    <li>If you are pressed for time for a standard chart type, it might be easier to use other tools / libraries built on top of D3. For example, <a href="http://nvd3.org/">NVD3</a> or <a href="https://c3js.org/">C3.js</a>.</li>
                    <li>You can also use other libraries (leaflet, highcharts, etc.) to build the components you need.</li>
                    <li>There are even full platforms - Mapbox, Cesium, etc. that will allow you to host and build on top of those platforms.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <hr/>
                    <p class="smallfont">This is my bias. You are not going to get glassy visualizations for the web without coding it natively for the web.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Course expectations</h3>
                    <p>Basic web development is a technical requirement for this course. It is expected that you know some basic <b>HTML / CSS / JS</b>.</p>
                    <p>We'll go through some recap refreshers, but it will be quick.</p>
                    <p>If you absolutely have no experience in this area you probably will have to do your own reading and self-revision.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p class="smallfont">There are lots of tutorials on the web for HTML / CSS / JS.</p>
                    <p class="smallfont">It will be great if you are more technical and know more &mdash; CSS /JS frameworks, web architecture frontend / backend, etc. &mdash; but it is not required for this course.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h3>Course expectations 2</h3>
                    <p>On the JS side, you should hopefully also know how to pull data from APIs, have some familarity in data formats like JSON (E.g. GeoJSON).</p>
                    <p>Beyond HTML / CSS / JS, we will also be using <b>Git</b>, a version control tool.</p>
                    <p>Students will be publishing their assignments and work on <b>GitHub</b> and <b>GitPages</b>.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p class="smallfont">If you do not have a GitHub account, please do sign up for one.</p>
                    <p class="smallfont">I will do a survey later, and also go through with the class on self-introduction and understand your expectations of the course.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>Course expectations 3</h3>
                    <p>However, if you prefer to use other web-based tools for projects, you are free to do so.</p>
                    <p>The only requirement is that you need to be able to publish your work on a GitHub repository (through GitPages).</p>
                    <p>For coordination for this module, we will be using communication tool <b>Slack</b>.</p>
                    <hr/>
                    <p class="smallfont">I'll collect emails from all of you folks so i can add you to the slack account.</p>
                </section>
                
                <section>
                    <h3>The spirit of the course</h3>
                    <p>I see the masters course as a learning and networking experience, and I hope you see it as something beyond grades.</p>
                    <p>Grade wise, as long as you complete the 5 assignments and the <a href="projects2021.html">visualization projects</a>, I will try to give you a good grade (last year were all B+ and above).</p>
                    <p>It is an opportunity to connect with people in this domain and to see what it is about.</p>
                    <p>Let's all learn and have some fun.</p>
